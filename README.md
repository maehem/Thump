# Thump
Java port of Doom from original C source code.

Thump is an attempt to port Doom to Java using object oriented methdology and adapting the original source code from C-structs to objects and methods.

The archived branch called "pre-maven" is a Netbeans, Ant-based project.  This "master" branch is a Maven based project and comes with many code refactors and new module considerations, which are subject to change as development continues.

This branch will also focus on porting the AWT/Swing usage over to Java 13+, OpenJavaFX 13+ and Netbeans 11.3+.

The author has created this project for no other reason other than to study and transform the original Doom C-source to Java as well as stay versed on the use of JavaFX in a novel way.  This software is not intended to be used, sold or even ever finished.  The author reserves the right to abandon or "park" this code for indefinite amounts of time to go work on other interests.  You may do what you want with this code within the limits of the software license.  Learn, study, enjoy!
