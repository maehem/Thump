Once you beat the big badasses and\n \
clean out the moon base youre supposed\n \
to win, arent you? Arent you? Wheres\n \
your fat reward and ticket home? What\n \
the hell is this? Its not supposed to\n \
end this way!\n \
\n \
It stinks like rotten meat, but looks\n \
like the lost Deimos base.  Looks like\n \
youre stuck on The Shores of Hell.\n \
The only way out is through.\n \
 \n \
To continue the DOOM experience, play\n \
The Shores of Hell and its amazing\n \
sequel, Inferno!\n


    E2TEXT= \
Youve done it! The hideous cyber-\n \
demon lord that ruled the lost Deimos\n \
moon base has been slain and you\n \
are triumphant! But ... where are\n \
you? You clamber to the edge of the\n \
moon and look down to see the awful\n \
truth.\n \
\n \
Deimos floats above Hell itself!\n \
Youve never heard of anyone escaping\n \
from Hell, but youll make the bastards\n \
sorry they ever heard of you! Quickly,\n \
you rappel down to  the surface of\n \
Hell.\n \
 \n \
Now, its on to the final chapter of\n \
DOOM! -- Inferno.


E3TEXT= \
The loathsome spiderdemon that\n \
masterminded the invasion of the moon\n \
bases and caused so much death has had\n \
its ass kicked for all time.\n \
\n \
A hidden doorway opens and you enter.\n \
Youve proven too tough for Hell to\n \
contain, and now Hell at last plays\n \
fair -- for you emerge from the door\n \
to see the green fields of Earth!\n \
Home at last.\n \
 \n \
You wonder whats been happening on\n \
Earth while you were battling evil\n \
unleashed. Its good that no Hell-\n \
spawn could have come through that\n \
door with you ...


E4TEXT= \
The spider mastermind must have sent forth\n \
its legions of hellspawn before your\n \
final confrontation with that terrible\n \
beast from hell.  but you stepped forward\n \
and brought forth eternal damnation and\n \
suffering upon the horde as a true hero\n \
would in the face of something so evil.\n \
 \n \
besides, someone was gonna pay for what\n \
happened to daisy, your pet rabbit.\n \
 \n \
but now, you see spread before you more\n \
potential pain and gibbitude as a nation\n \
of demons run amok among our cities.\n \
 \n \
next stop, hell on earth!


# after level 6, put this:
C1TEXT= \
YOU HAVE ENTERED DEEPLY INTO THE INFESTED\n \
STARPORT. BUT SOMETHING IS WRONG. THE\n \
MONSTERS HAVE BROUGHT THEIR OWN REALITY\n \
WITH THEM, AND THE STARPORTS TECHNOLOGY\n \
IS BEING SUBVERTED BY THEIR PRESENCE.\n \
 \n \
AHEAD, YOU SEE AN OUTPOST OF HELL, A\n \
FORTIFIED ZONE. IF YOU CAN GET PAST IT,\n \
YOU CAN PENETRATE INTO THE HAUNTED HEART\n \
OF THE STARBASE AND FIND THE CONTROLLING\n \
SWITCH WHICH HOLDS EARTHS POPULATION\n \
HOSTAGE.

# After level 11, put this:
C2TEXT= \
YOU HAVE WON! YOUR VICTORY HAS ENABLED\n \
HUMANKIND TO EVACUATE EARTH AND ESCAPE\n \
THE NIGHTMARE.  NOW YOU ARE THE ONLY\n \
HUMAN LEFT ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET.\n \
CANNIBAL MUTATIONS, CARNIVOROUS ALIENS,\n \
AND EVIL SPIRITS ARE YOUR ONLY NEIGHBORS.\n \
YOU SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR DEATH, CONTENT\n \
THAT YOU HAVE SAVED YOUR SPECIES.\n \
 \n \
BUT THEN, EARTH CONTROL BEAMS DOWN A\n \
MESSAGE FROM SPACE: \SENSORS HAVE LOCATED\n \
THE SOURCE OF THE ALIEN INVASION. IF YOU\n \
GO THERE, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BLOCK THEIR\n \
ENTRY.  THE ALIEN BASE IS IN THE HEART OF\n \
YOUR OWN HOME CITY, NOT FAR FROM THE\n \
STARPORT.\ SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY YOU GET\n \
UP AND RETURN TO THE FRAY.


# After level 20, put this:
C3TEXT= \
YOU ARE AT THE CORRUPT HEART OF THE CITY,\n \
SURROUNDED BY THE CORPSES OF YOUR ENEMIES.\n \
YOU SEE NO WAY TO DESTROY THE CREATURES\n \
ENTRYWAY ON THIS SIDE, SO YOU CLENCH YOUR\n \
TEETH AND PLUNGE THROUGH IT.\n \
 \n \
THERE MUST BE A WAY TO CLOSE IT ON THE\n \
OTHER SIDE. WHAT DO YOU CARE IF YOUVE\n \
GOT TO GO THROUGH HELL TO GET TO IT?


# After level 29, put this:
C4TEXT= \
THE HORRENDOUS VISAGE OF THE BIGGEST\n \
DEMON YOUVE EVER SEEN CRUMBLES BEFORE\n \
YOU, AFTER YOU PUMP YOUR ROCKETS INTO\n \
HIS EXPOSED BRAIN. THE MONSTER SHRIVELS\n \
UP AND DIES, ITS THRASHING LIMBS\n \
DEVASTATING UNTOLD MILES OF HELLS\n \
SURFACE.\n \
 \n \
YOUVE DONE IT. THE INVASION IS OVER.\n \
EARTH IS SAVED. HELL IS A WRECK. YOU\n \
WONDER WHERE BAD FOLKS WILL GO WHEN THEY\n \
DIE, NOW. WIPING THE SWEAT FROM YOUR\n \
FOREHEAD YOU BEGIN THE LONG TREK BACK\n \
HOME. REBUILDING EARTH OUGHT TO BE A\n \
LOT MORE FUN THAN RUINING IT WAS.\n


# Before level 31, put this:
C5TEXT= \
CONGRATULATIONS, YOUVE FOUND THE SECRET\n \
LEVEL! LOOKS LIKE ITS BEEN BUILT BY\n \
HUMANS, RATHER THAN DEMONS. YOU WONDER\n \
WHO THE INMATES OF THIS CORNER OF HELL\n \
WILL BE.


# Before level 32, put this:
C6TEXT= \
CONGRATULATIONS, YOUVE FOUND THE\n \
SUPER SECRET LEVEL!  YOUD BETTER\n \
BLAZE THROUGH THIS ONE!\n


# after map 06	
P1TEXT=  \
You gloat over the steaming carcass of the\n \
Guardian.  With its death, youve wrested\n \
the Accelerator from the stinking claws\n \
of Hell.  You relax and glance around the\n \
room.  Damn!  There was supposed to be at\n \
least one working prototype, but you cant\n \
see it. The demons must have taken it.\n \
\n \
You must find the prototype, or all your\n \
struggles will have been wasted. Keep\n \
moving, keep fighting, keep killing.\n \
Oh yes, keep living, too.


# after map 11
P2TEXT= \
Even the deadly Arch-Vile labyrinth could\n \
not stop you, and youve gotten to the\n \
prototype Accelerator which is soon\n \
efficiently and permanently deactivated.\n \
\n \
Youre good at that kind of thing.


# after map 20
P3TEXT= \
Youve bashed and battered your way into\n \
the heart of the devil-hive.  Time for a\n \
Search-and-Destroy mission, aimed at the\n \
Gatekeeper, whose foul offspring is\n \
cascading to Earth.  Yeah, hes bad. But\n \
you know whos worse!\n \
 \n \
Grinning evilly, you check your gear, and\n \
get ready to give the bastard a little Hell\n \
of your own making!

# after map 30
P4TEXT= \
The Gatekeepers evil face is splattered\n \
all over the place.  As its tattered corpse\n \
collapses, an inverted Gate forms and\n \
sucks down the shards of the last\n \
prototype Accelerator, not to mention the\n \
few remaining demons.  Youre done. Hell\n \
has gone back to pounding bad dead folks \n \
instead of good live ones.  Remember to\n \
tell your grandkids to put a rocket\n \
launcher in your coffin. If you go to Hell\n \
when you die, youll need it for some\n \
final cleaning-up ...

# before map 31
P5TEXT= \
Youve found the second-hardest level we\n \
got. Hope you have a saved game a level or\n \
two previous.  If not, be prepared to die\n \
aplenty. For master marines only.

# before map 32
P6TEXT= \
Betcha wondered just what WAS the hardest\n \
level we had ready for ya?  Now you know.\n \
No one gets out alive.


T1TEXT= \
Youve fought your way out of the infested\n \
experimental labs.   It seems that UAC has\n \
once again gulped it down.  With their\n \
high turnover, it must be hard for poor\n \
old UAC to buy corporate health insurance\n \
nowadays..\n \
 \n \
Ahead lies the military complex, now\n \
swarming with diseased horrors hot to get\n \
their teeth into you. With luck, the\n \
complex still has some warlike ordnance\n \
laying around.


T2TEXT= \
You hear the grinding of heavy machinery\n \
ahead.  You sure hope theyre not stamping\n \
out new hellspawn, but youre ready to\n \
ream out a whole herd if you have to.\n \
They might be planning a blood feast, but\n \
you feel about as mean as two thousand\n \
maniacs packed into one mad killer.\n \
 \n \
You dont plan to go down easy.


T3TEXT= \
The vista opening ahead looks real damn\n \
familiar. Smells familiar, too -- like\n \
fried excrement. You didnt like this\n \
place before, and you sure as hell aint\n \
planning to like it now. The more you\n \
brood on it, the madder you get.\n \
Hefting your gun, an evil grin trickles\n \
onto your face. Time to take some names.

T4TEXT= \
Suddenly, all is silent, from one horizon\n \
to the other. The agonizing echo of Hell\n \
fades away, the nightmare sky turns to\n \
blue, the heaps of monster corpses start \n \
to evaporate along with the evil stench \n \
that filled the air. Jeeze, maybe youve\n \
done it. Have you really won?\n \
 \n \
Something rumbles in the distance.\n \
A blue light begins to glow inside the\n \
ruined skull of the demon-spitter.


T5TEXT= \
What now? Looks totally different. Kind\n \
of like King Tuts condo. Well,\n \
whatevers here cant be any worse\n \
than usual. Can it?  Or maybe its best\n \
to let sleeping gods lie..


T6TEXT= \
Time for a vacation. Youve burst the\n \
bowels of hell and by golly youre ready\n \
for a break. You mutter to yourself,\n \
Maybe someone else can kick Hells ass\n \
next time around. Ahead lies a quiet town,\n \
with peaceful flowing water, quaint\n \
buildings, and presumably no Hellspawn.\n \
 \n \
As you step off the transport, you hear\n \
the stomp of a cyberdemons iron shoe.
